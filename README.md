# csvLib
A library with functions for managing CSV files in C.

Currently, documentation is a low priority, however, there are future plans for documentation. 
Roadmap -
1. Implement functions for removing empty rows/columns
2. Implement "headers" that can be used for index - row 0 and column 0 have the option of being labels that are used to describe their datasets.
3. Add functionality for sorting data - sorting alphabetically and numerically
4. Expand upon "easy" functions - Minimal user overhead to work with csv files.
5. Testing
6. Documentation.
